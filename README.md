# FAQ

## I see similar workflows on packal.orgâ€”why this one?

I made this workflow because the existing ones either didn't allow searching (you'd need to have the file selected in a Finder window) or would only allow searching for folders (sometimes I just need to quick-edit a single file).

## Can I specify which file types to filter in the search results?

Yep! Just click the "File Filter" node in the workflow's settings to customize the file types and search scope. By default, all file types are returned across all folders in your home directory.
